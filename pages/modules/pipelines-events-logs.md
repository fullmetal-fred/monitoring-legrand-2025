# Events & Logs

- Logs and events each offer unique insights into system behavior
- Understanding the differences and use cases is crucial for effective monitoring
- Integrating events and logs can provide a comprehensive view of system performance
- If you have the chance to incorporate both, do it!

# Definition of Events

An event is any occurrence or change in state within a system.

- Triggered by specific conditions
- Indicates changes or significant actions
- Examples: user actions, display turned on, problems...

<PresenterTimer :minutes="1" :seconds="30" />

<!--
>
Explain the concept of an event in the context of AV system monitoring.
Provide examples to illustrate the concept.
-->

---

# Definition of Logs

Logs are records of events that have occurred within a system.

- Sequential records of system activities
- Contains detailed information about events
- Used for troubleshooting and analysis

<PresenterTimer :minutes="1" :seconds="30" />

<!--
>
Clarify the definition of logs.
Discuss their role in system monitoring and why they are important.
-->

---

# Differences Between Events and Logs

While both events and logs are crucial, they serve different purposes.

- Events: high-level occurrences, often triggered by specific conditions
- Logs: detailed records of these occurrences, providing context
- Events often trigger log entries

<PresenterTimer :minutes="2" :seconds="0" />

<!--
>
Highlight the key differences between events and logs.
Explain how they complement each other in system monitoring.
