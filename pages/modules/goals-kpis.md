# Finding Why: Review

Putting words to the reason we want to monitor in the first place

<v-clicks>

- Sometimes called a [mission]{.highlight} / [vision]{.highlight} / [purpose]{.highlight}, etc
- Answer the question of "[why]{.highlight}"
- Focuses on the [big picture]{.highlight}
- Aligns the team around a [unified purpose]{.highlight}
- Think of it like a [mega goal]{.highlight}
- Should be [clear]{.highlight} and [concise]{.highlight}
- All goals and KPIs should [tie back to this]{.highlight}

</v-clicks>

<!--
- You don't normally get to define why, you are often responding to it...it just helps if you have a super clear understanding of what it is and are aligned with others on that
- Foundation of everything we're going to do...you want to get this one right.
- Focus on pain points...what is the big picture problem that we're trying to solve?
- This is what you rally people around. 
- Why are we doing this? 
- What is the big picture problem that we're trying to solve?
- What is the big picture opportunity that we're trying to capture?

# Finding Why: Activity

A roll-play scenario

- Extract the "why" from [Wallace]{.highlight}
- Answer the question of ["what does success look like?"]{.highlight}
- Listen, empathize, and [seek to understand]{.highlight}
- [Balance]{.highlight} curiosity with respect

<br/>

<Timer :minutes="5" />

<!--
We'll role-play a scenario where you will extract the "why" from Wallace, played by me.
Afterwards, we will discuss what you learned and how you might turn that into goals and KPIs.

SCENARIO:

- Wallace, has called an emergency 1:1 to ensure you're on the same page regarding the monitoring project. 
- As he is going out of office for the rest of the week, he wants to make sure you have everything you need to get started.
- This is your one chance to get it right.

FRED: 
Get them here - 
1. To improve the daily experience of our colleagues by ensuring that the audiovisual systems they rely on [are available and functioning as expected
2. To validate and justify the continued investment in these systems through data-driven insights into their performance and utilization.

# Goals: Review

The milestones towards accomplishing the mission

<v-clicks>

- Goals show us the path to [success]{.highlight} in our [mission]{.highlight}
- Contract between the [team]{.highlight} and the [business]{.highlight}
- Be [SMART]{.highlight}
  - Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound
- One person should ultimately be [responsible]{.highlight} for each goal
- Keep it [simple]{.highlight}
- Establishing a [baseline]{.highlight} is a valid goal if you don't have one

</v-clicks>

<!--
- One owner per goal
- Creates accontability and focus
- Don't go right for "decrease x by y%"...start with "establish a baseline for KPI x and can be used as a service-level indicator in the future"

# Goals: SMART

Good goals are...

<v-clicks>

- [S]{.highlight}pecific
- [M]{.highlight}easurable
- [A]{.highlight}chievable
- [R]{.highlight}elevant
- [T]{.highlight}ime-bound

</v-clicks>

<!--
- Specific: What are you trying to achieve?
- Measurable: How will you know when you've achieved it?
- Achievable: Is it possible to achieve this goal?
- Relevant: Does this goal align with the "why"?
- Time-bound: When do you need to achieve this goal by?

# Goals: Good or Bad

Is this a good goal or a bad goal, and why?

<v-clicks>

- "Improve AV systems"
- "Reduce 'ghost meetings' to fewer than 5% of meetings by the end of Q3"

# KPIs: Review

"Key Performance Indicators" are our finger on the pulse

<v-clicks>

- KPIs measure our [progress]{.highlight} towards our goals
- Built from underlying [data points]{.highlight}
- Important to know what values are [good]{.highlight} and what values are [bad]{.highlight}
  - Thresholds, SLAs, Goals, etc ... driven by the business
- Codifies our methodology for [calculating]{.highlight} a KPI
  - Source data
  - Frequency
  - Units
- Clearly states [who is responsible]{.highlight} for delivering on this KPI

</v-clicks>

<!--
- Maybe do one or two brief examples.
- Don't get into HOW to collect the data yet, focus on the goals and the KPIs
- The M in SMART ...we know what we want to do, we know WHY we want to do it, but how do we know IF WE'RE ACTUALLY DOING IT?
- Again, generally one owner per KPI, as a given KPI usually maps to a given goal

# KPIs: Components

What makes up a KPI?

<v-clicks>

- **Name**: What are you calling this KPI?
- **Goal**: What are you trying to achieve?
- **Units**: How are you measuring it?
- **Calculation methodology**: How are you calculating it?
- **Target**: What are you aiming for? Could be associated with an SLA.
- **Frequency**: How often are you measuring it?
- **Owner**: Who is responsible for this?

</v-clicks>

<!--
- No more than 3 KPIs per goal...usually ONE is best!

# KPIs vs SLAs

What's the difference?

<v-clicks>

- KPIs are [indicators]{.highlight} of how well you're doing
- They are the same as SLIs ([Service Level Indicators]{.highlight})
- SLOs ([Service Level Objectives]{.highlight}) are [targets]{.highlight} on how well you want to do
- SLAs ([Service Level Agreements]{.highlight}) are [commitments]{.highlight} on how well you will do, typically with [consequences]{.highlight} for not meeting them. They are [composed]{.highlight} of SLIs and SLOs.

# KPIs: Example

Just for fun

| KPI                                             | Units                  | Goal                                                             | Methodology                                    | Target                   | Frequency          | Owner                     |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------------- |
| [Ice cream scoops lost due to melting]{v-click} | [% of scoops]{v-after} | [Establish and track an audiovisual system uptime SLA.]{v-after} | [(Lost scoops / Total scoops) \* 100]{v-after} | [50% reduction]{v-after} | [Monthly]{v-after} | [Branch manager]{v-after} |

<!--
- Problems with this? 
- Imprecise...challenging to determine what percentage of a scoop is lost due to melting. 
- Scoop is not a standard unit of measure, so it's hard to compare. 
- How do you determine if ice cream was lost due to melting or due to some other reason? 
- Ways to fix it? 
- What is the real issue? Are customers complaining about their ice cream melting? 
- Customer complaints are measurable. 
- Instead focus on a CSAT with some specific attributions as to why they are unhappy (if they are)
- Etc

# One last point

Build your house on a solid foundation

- Goals & KPIs are useless if they are not...
  - clearly communicated in writing
  - mutually agreed upon after discussion
  - fully understood by all stakeholders
- Get buy-in during and after this process to get everyone aligned

<!--
- Get buy-in during and after this process to get everyone aligned. 
- This will help you when you need to make decisions later on, and will rediuce the chances of being blindsided by someone who doesn't understand what you're doing or why you're doing it.

# Key Takeaways

- [Goals]{v-click .reveal} need to be extracted from the "why" and should be [SMART]{v-click .reveal}.
- The SMART Goal acronym stands for [Specific]{v-click .reveal}, [Measurable]{v-click .reveal}, [Achievable]{v-click .reveal}, [Relevant]{v-click .reveal}, and [Time-bound]{v-click .reveal}.
- [KPIs]{v-click .reveal} should be tied to specific goals and include a [methodology]{v-click .reveal} for calculation.
- [Goals]{v-click .reveal} are what you're trying to achieve, and [KPIs]{v-click .reveal} are how you know you're making progress.
- Why is it important to get buy-in on goals and KPIs?
