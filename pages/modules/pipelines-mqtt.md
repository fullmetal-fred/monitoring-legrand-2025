Data Pipelines

# MQTT

The new kid on the block

---

# Introduction to MQTT

- **Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT)**
- Lightweight messaging protocol for small sensors and mobile devices
- Publish/subscribe model
- Efficient for networks with limited bandwidth

---

# MQTT in Audiovisual Monitoring

- Real-time data exchange
- Device status updates
- Remote control capabilities
- Integration with AV system management platforms

---

# How MQTT Works

- **Broker**: Central hub that routes messages
- **Client**: Device or application that publishes/subscribes to topics
- **Topics**: Hierarchical subject categories for messages
- **QoS Levels**: Quality of Service - 0 (at most once), 1 (at least once), 2 (exactly once)

---

# Benefits of Using MQTT

- Low bandwidth usage
- Scalability for large networks
- Reliability with different QoS levels
- Interoperability with various devices and platforms

---

# Setting Up MQTT for AV Monitoring

- Choose an MQTT broker (e.g., Mosquitto, HiveMQ)
- Configure AV devices as MQTT clients
- Define topics for various monitoring metrics (e.g., /av/status, /av/control)
- Implement security measures (SSL/TLS, authentication)

---

# Common Applications

- Monitoring device status (e.g., online/offline, errors)
- Remote control of AV equipment (e.g., turning on/off, changing inputs)
- Environmental monitoring (e.g., temperature, humidity)
- Alerting and notifications (e.g., system errors, performance metrics)

---

# Case Study: Conference Room Monitoring

- Devices: Projector, microphone, lighting, HVAC
- Topics: /room1/projector/status, /room1/microphone/level
- Benefits: Real-time monitoring, remote troubleshooting, improved resource management

# Example of MQTT in Node-RED

<!--
1. **Setup**: Install Node-RED and MQTT broker
2. **Flow Creation**:
   - MQTT input node to subscribe to a topic
   - Processing node to handle incoming data
   - MQTT output node to publish responses
3. **Example**: Monitor and control a projector
   - Subscribe to /projector/status
   - Publish to /projector/control
   - Live data visualization on Node-RED dashboard
4. **Wrap-Up**: Recap the steps and highlight the benefits of using Node-RED with MQTT

# Best Practices

- **Security**: Use encrypted connections, strong authentication, and access control
- **Scalability**: Design topics for easy expansion, use efficient message formats
- **Monitoring**: Regularly check broker performance, device connectivity, and message flow
- **Maintenance**: Keep software updated, perform regular backups, document system configurations
