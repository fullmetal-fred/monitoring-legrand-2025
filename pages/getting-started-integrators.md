# Where do we go from here

Getting started

<v-clicks>

1. Assemble the team
2. Set clear goals
3. Define your offer
4. Choose a platform
5. Start small & iterate

</v-clicks>

<!--
- [click] So where do we go from here the first step as always to get the right people to the table. Monitoring is a team sport, and you need to make sure that you have the right people in place to make it work.
- [click] Next, you need to set clear goals. What are you trying to achieve with monitoring? What does success look like? How will you know when you've achieved it?
- [click] Once you have your goals, you need to define your offer. What are your customers looking for? What are they willing to pay? What are you going to charge for it? Don't get too far without answering these questions. You're building a new offer, and you need to make sure that it's going to be successful.
- [click] Next you need to choose a platform. There are many monitoring platforms out there, and you need to choose the one that's right for you.
- [click] Once you've chosen a platform, you need to start small. Don't try to monitor everything at once. Start with a small, manageable project, and build from there.  Monitoring is an ongoing process, and you need to be constantly refining and improving your monitoring strategy.

# Assemble the team

Getting started

<v-clicks>

- Service leadership
- Service team
- Integration/ops leadership
- Engineering
- IT team
- Sales & marketing
- Customers

</v-clicks>

<!--
- Monitoring is a team sport, and you need to make sure that you have the right people in place to make it work.
- You need to make sure that you have buy-in from all levels of the organization, from the leadership team down to the service team.
- [click] Service leadership. If you're building a monitoring offer, then your service leadership should own this initiative. Their leadership and ownership will be critical. Any monitoring-related KPIs, implementation status, etc will all be run by them, or by someone they designate on their team. They have ultimate responsibility for delivering this successfully. If they're not on board, you're going to have a hard time getting this off the ground.
- [click] Service team. Your service team will be the ones who are actually using the monitoring tools. They need to be on board with the initiative, have a big hand in defining the requirements, and need to be trained on how to use the tools effectively. They also need to be able to provide feedback on the tools, and help to refine and improve them over time.
- [click] Integration/ops leadership. A key part of onboarding customers into the monitoring offer will involve handoff from the project team to the service team. This will require close coordination between the two teams, and the integration/ops leadership will be responsible for making sure that this handoff goes smoothly. Clear expectations need to be set on how handoff will work, and the service team needs to feel confident they can hold the project team accountable for delivering a system that can be monitored.
- [click] Engineering. Your design engineers will be designing systems every day, and their decisions will determine how easy or difficult it is to monitor those systems. They need to be on board with the monitoring initiative, and need to be designing systems with monitoring in mind, or the whole thing can fall apart.
- [click] IT team. Your IT team will likely own the core administrative functions (user management, licensing, hosting) for the monitoring platform, so get their take and keep them involved. Often IT leadership has the final say on software application use, so don't neglect to involve them. You'll need to work out many details, like how to integrate the monitoring platform with your existing systems, how to manage user accounts, how to handle licensing, and how to host the monitoring platform. You'll also need to work out how to handle data privacy and security, and how to ensure that the monitoring platform is compliant with any relevant regulations. Finally, you'll need to ensure an IT support process is in place for the monitoring platform, so that any issues can be resolved quickly and efficiently.
- [click] Sales & marketing. Your sales and marketing teams will be responsible for selling the monitoring offer to customers. so they need to understand the value proposition of the monitoring offer, and be able to communicate that value proposition to customers. They also need to be able to explain how the monitoring offer works, and how it will benefit customers. Finally, they need to be able to handle any objections that customers might have to the monitoring offer, and be able to close the sale. This often ends up being a bottle neck, so don't neglect to involve them early and often.
- [click] Most importantly: Customers. Your customers are the ultimate stakeholders in the monitoring offer, so you need to make sure you understand what it is that they want. You need to be able to explain the value proposition of the monitoring offer to customers, and be able to show them how it will benefit them. Finally, you need to be able to deliver the monitoring offer to customers in a way that meets their needs and expectations. Do not bring an offer to market that nobody wants. Also make sure to get a few customers as beta testers, and involve them in the process of refining the offer. It'll earn you a lot of goodwill, and you'll end up with a better product.

# Set clear goals

Getting started

<v-clicks>

- Goals show us the path to [success]{.highlight} in our monitoring journey
- They set the [scope]{.highlight} of our monitoring initiative
- Be [SMART]{.highlight}
  - Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound
- One person should ultimately be [responsible]{.highlight} for each goal
- Keep it [simple]{.highlight}

</v-clicks>

---

<PresenterTimer :minutes="3" :seconds="0" />

# Good goal / bad goal

Getting started

<v-clicks>

- "Solve customer problems faster"
- "Reduce monthly mean time to resolution on customer issues (MTTR) by 10% YoY"
- "Resolve customer issues proactively"
- "Implement a new KPI for "% of self-reported incidents" and establish a baseline during 2024"
- "Reduce cost of truck rolls"
- "Implement remote access along with monitoring and reduce on-site service trips by 5% in the first year"

</v-clicks>

<!--
- The point here is that if you want to achieve something, you need to be able to measure it. If you can't measure it, you can't manage it. So don't set crappy, vague, unmeasurable goals. Set good, specific, measurable goals that you can track over time.
- And make sure the goals are realistic. Don't set a goal that you can't achieve. You'll just end up demoralizing your team and wasting time.
- Now it's time to define our service offer, but before we do, let's introduce a few
-->

<PresenterTimer :minutes="2" :seconds="0" />

# Defining your service offer

Getting started

<v-clicks>

- Offer definition and structure
- Service delivery model
- End-to-end customer journey
- Pricing model
- Managed v Support services

</v-clicks>

<!--
- How will your offer be structured? Most integrators have never really need to build a new service offer...custom integration has been the bread and butter for so long. But now you're building a new service offer, and you need to make sure that it's going to be successful.
- What are you selling? Clearly define it and write it down.
- How will you deliver the service? Will it be a one-time setup, or an ongoing service? What parts of the company will be involved? Are they all on the team? What will the customer experience be like?
- Journey maps
- Pricing: one time, recurring, annual, monthly, multi-year, priced by percent of job, device, system, usage, etc.
- Will this be a managed service or a support service? What's the difference? Let's actually talk about that

# Managed services vs Support services

Getting started

::left::

**Support services**

<v-clicks>

- No uptime guarantee
- Break/fix
- They own the passwords
- They own the gear
- Stack focus will be on
  - Remote access
  - Basic, fast monitoring
  - Only go deeper when needed

</v-clicks>

::right::

**Managed services**

<v-clicks>

- SLA-bound with clawbacks
- Proactive
- You own the passwords
- You own the gear
- Stack focus will be On
  - Health modeling
  - Granular data collection
  - SLA measurements

</v-clicks>

<!--
- Think SERIOUSLY on the difference here. Building managed services requires a ton of maturity that you may not be ready for, and that is OK! 
- Support services is a great way to start dipping your toes in the water and increasing your recurring revenue. 
- It also requires MUCH less of your monitoring tools, your sales teams, your support teams, and more. 
- So if you are sitting under 25% of total revenues being recurring, focus on growing that number through support services first while you workshop more in-depth managed service roles and grow your service maturity level. As a matter of fact, if you're interested in support services growth, I even have some general guidance for you to get you started.

# Fred's guidance on support services offers

Getting started

<v-clicks>

- Focus on one, really good support services offer
- Price by % of the total cost of the job, proposed on every job
- Include remote access and remote monitoring, increase price if declined
- Sell service, not software. No demos, no portal access. Tools are for you only.
- Guarantee fast remote response time, avoid on-site service
- Offer 3-years by default, 1-year as an option (show savings)
- Make customers explicitly decline service if they don't want it
- Increase commissions for recurring revenue

# A final check

Getting started

Is your offer...

<div class="flex justify-between h-80%">

<v-clicks>

- Desirable
- Feasible
- Viable

</v-clicks>

<img v-click src="/dvf.jpg" alt="Desirable, Feasible, Viable" class="h-80 rounded-3xl" />

</div>

<!--
-
- [click] Desirablity: Do you have real customers that want this and are WILLING TO PAY for it? Will they allocate budget for it in advance? Will they sign up as a pilot user with transition terms to full service at the end of the contract?
- [click] Feasibility: Can you actually deliver this? Do you have the resources, expertise, and technology to make this happen? If not can you acquire them? Do those things even exist?
- [click] Viability: Will this be profitable? Is it worth the effort? Will it be sustainable? Could it disrupt your existing business? Are you ok with that risk?
- [click] These 3 things overlap in a very specific way. If you have a service that is desirable and feasible, but not viable, you're wasting time and money "saddling a dead horse" 
- If you have a service that is desirable and viable, but not feasible, you won't be able to deliver it, which will only alienate your customers and frustrate your team.  
- If you have a service that is feasible and viable, but not desirable, not enough people will buy it, and ultimately it will fail. This is where most people fall. We spend so much time making sure we can do it and that it will make money, that we forget to ask our customers if they'd want it in the first place. 
- So make sure that your service offer is all three: desirable, feasible, and viable.

# Choose a platform

Getting started

<v-clicks>

- Align feature requirements with goals
- Balance sophistication vs simplicity
- Get clear on costs
- Look outside of AV too
- Self-hosted vs SaaS
- Make sure it has the security story you need
- Do a proof of value
- Fail fast

</v-clicks>

<!--
- Now that you have clearly defined objectives, it's time to choose a platform. There are many monitoring platforms out there, and you need to choose the one that's right for you.
- The most important thing is to [click] align your requirements with your goals. If your goal is to reduce the mean time to resolution on customer issues, then you need a platform that is going to enable you to solve problems faster. If your goal is to reduce the cost of truck rolls, then you need a platform that is going to empower you to solve issues remotely. If your goal is to implement a new KPI for "% of self-reported incidents", then you need a platform with robust data collection and alerting capabilities. Make sure that the platform you choose is going to help you achieve your goals.
- [click] sophisticated vs simple. Some platforms are very sophisticated, with lots of features and capabilities. Others are very simple, with just the basics. You need to decide what level of sophistication you need. If you're looking to facilitate a support services model, you likely don't need detailed or robust monitoring capabilities. If you're looking to facilitate a managed services model, you'll need to do health modeling, SLA measurements, and more, so sophistication is key.
- [click]
  - Sensitive
  - Cost model MUST match how you sell the product
  - Either pass-through / cost-plus, or expense on the back end
  - Depends on how you sell it, customer tolerance, etc.
  - If you've got a bad feeling, you're probably right.
  - Validate your customer's willingness to pay!
- [click]
  - Don't limit yourself
  - AV generally sucks at this
  - Monitoring is completely commoditized in the IT world
  - Don't reinvent the wheel
- [click]
  - Self-Hosted: You host it, you manage it, you own it, you operate it
  - Requires more internal resources and expertise
  - Cheaper in long run, more expensive to start
  - SaaS: Someone else hosts it, someone else manages it, someone else owns it
  - Likely more support available and less responsibility on you
  - More expensive in long run, cheaper to start
  - Depends on what your team is capable of and what your goals are
  - [click] Security: Make sure that the platform you choose has the security story you need. AV Pros are not famed for their security and compliance chops. You'll need your platform to back you up with a great security story and certifications like SOC2 Type 2 and ISO 270001.
- [click] Do a proof of value. Before you commit to a platform, do a proof of value. Set up a small, manageable project, and see how the platform performs. Make sure that it's going to meet your needs before you commit to it.
- [click] And remember, you can always change platforms. If you find that the platform you've chosen isn't meeting your needs, don't be afraid to switch. It's better to switch early and often than to stick with a platform that isn't working for you.

# Start small & iterate

Getting started

<v-clicks>

- Pilot your offer with a few loyal customers
- Get structured feedback early and often
- Recognize that you will need to iterate
- Don't be afraid to fail, it's a guarantee

</v-clicks>

<!--
- The key is to start small and not try to boil the ocean.
- [click] Work with close customers. Honest & forgiving. 
- [click] Get structured feedback. Try Keep Start Stop session. What's working, what's not, what's missing, what's confusing, what's frustrating. Make sure these sessions happen and the service offer manager is present and incorporating feedback. 
- [click] Recognize that you will need to iterate. Your first version of the offer will not be perfect. You will need to refine and improve it over time. Make sure that you have a process in place for collecting feedback, and that you are constantly refining and improving your offer.
- [click] Don't be afraid to fail. You will fail. It's a guarantee. But that's ok. Failure is a part of the process. Learn from your failures, and use them to improve your offer.
