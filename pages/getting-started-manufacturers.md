- [click] Define your data storage strategy:
  - Local storage on devices (limited capacity but always available)
  - Edge aggregation points (balances local access with more storage)
  - Cloud storage (unlimited capacity but requires connectivity)
  - Consider data retention policies, aggregation, and summarization techniques
  
- [click] Plan for massive scale from the beginning:
  - Architecture should support from one device to thousands
  - Consider bandwidth and storage implications at scale
  - Design efficient protocols that work well in constrained environments
  - Test with simulated large deployments early
  
- [click] Design multi-tenancy and access controls:
  - Multiple stakeholders need different views of the same devices

  - End customers need limited access to their own systems
  - Role-based access controls are essential
  
- [click] Build security in from the beginning:
  - Authentication for all monitoring interfaces
  - Encryption for data in transit and at rest
  - Secure credential management
  - Regular security assessments of monitoring infrastructure
  
- [click] Consider compatibility across product generations:
  - New monitoring features should work with existing deployed products where possible
  - Plan for graceful degradation with older products
