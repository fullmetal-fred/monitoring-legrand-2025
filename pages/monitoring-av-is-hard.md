# Why is monitoring AV hard?

Monitoring AV is hard

<v-clicks>

- Hardware & firmware means agentless
- Limited API standards or documentation
- Integrated systems have complex health models
- Insufficient commercial pressure
- Conflicts of interest

</v-clicks>

# Hardware & firmware means agentless

Monitoring AV is hard

::left::
<v-clicks>

- Typically monitoring is agent-based
    - Fetch locally & push
- Firmware-based hardware appliances can't run agents
- Can only monitor what the device provides
    - Sometimes push, usually poll
- Increases complexity and integration requirements
    - A new integration per device model / API
    - Sheer volume of unique AV products

</v-clicks>

# Limited API standards or documentation

Monitoring AV is hard

<v-clicks>

- While control APIs tend to be pretty good, management APIs are not
- No consistency in port, protocol, or data format
- Wildly varying levels of completeness
- No standardization across manufacturers, products, or even FW version
- On top of that, poor documentation

</v-clicks>

<!--
- Completeness: display that tells us what input its on may not tell us what temperature it currently is, or what its CPU / memory utilization is, or if it's dropping packets on the interface
- SNMP is a good example...even if we do have it, we likely don't have a MIB, nor does that SNMP cover the required telemetry on the device

# Integrated systems have complex health models

Monitoring AV is hard

<v-clicks>

- Measuring system health is the #1 most important thing in monitoring
- Health models codify the impact of potential failures in a system (ðŸ”´ðŸŸ¡ðŸŸ¢)
- AV systems are complex with many component interactions
    - More complexity, more potential failure points
- Each unique combination of gear requires a new health model
    - Large volume of bespoke systems makes this unsustainable
- Standards required for health modeling, otherwise unfeasible

# Insufficient commercial pressure

Monitoring AV is hard

<v-clicks>

- Manufacturers hold a lot of the cards here
- Insufficient commercial pressure to provide open, documented, stable APIs
- Not enough customers are demanding it / voting with their wallets

</v-clicks>

---

<PresenterTimer :minutes="1" :seconds="0" />

# Conflicts of interest

Monitoring AV is hard

<v-clicks>

- Many manufacturers want to sell you their own management tools
- Providing open monitoring APIs would compete with that
- Often not incentivized to make it easier for you to monitor your systems if it means you won't buy their tools

</v-clicks>

<!--
- SOME manufacturers, not all
- There are good guys out there too and I'm happy to point you in the right direction

# So what can we do?

Monitoring AV is hard

<v-clicks>

- Spec observable products and design observable systems
    - Subset of building systems that are manageable at scale
- Choose monitoring platforms that are flexible and support our needs
- Have a plan, start small, and iterate

</v-clicks>
