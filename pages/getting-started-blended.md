<!--
- [click] So where do we go from here? First, we need to assemble the right team. Monitoring is a team sport requiring diverse expertise from multiple departments.
- [click] Next, we need to set clear goals. What specific outcomes are we trying to achieve? How will we measure success?
- [click] Then we define our approach, which varies significantly depending on your role - whether you're an integrator creating a service offering, a tech manager implementing enterprise monitoring, or a manufacturer supporting monitoring capabilities in your products.
- [click] After defining the approach, we choose an appropriate platform that aligns with our goals and requirements.
- [click] Finally, we start small and iterate. Monitoring implementations should evolve through continuous improvement rather than attempting to build everything at once.

<!--
- Monitoring is a team sport requiring cross-functional expertise and buy-in from all organizational levels.
- [click] Leadership. For integrators, this means service leadership; for tech managers, AV technology leadership; for manufacturers, engineering and product leadership. They own the initiative and are responsible for its success. Any monitoring-related KPIs, implementation status, or resource allocation decisions run through this leadership.
- [click] Operations team. Whether you're a service team (integrator), AV operations team (tech manager), or production support team (manufacturer), these are the people who will interact with monitoring tools daily. They need to be involved in requirements definition and receive proper training.
- [click] Engineering team. For integrators, this means coordination between project teams and service. For tech managers, it's design engineers and programmers. For manufacturers, it's product engineering teams. All technical teams must design with monitoring in mind from the beginning for successful implementation.
- [click] IT partners. Your IT team will likely own core administrative functions for the monitoring platform. Involve them early to address integration details, security requirements, and compliance needs.
- [click] Product management (manufacturer specific). For manufacturers, product managers must understand how monitoring capabilities impact product market positioning, pricing strategies, and competitive differentiation.
- [click] Sales & marketing (integrator & manufacturer specific). These teams need to understand the value proposition and effectively communicate it to customers. For manufacturers, this includes explaining your products' monitoring capabilities as a differentiator.
- [click] Facilities management (tech manager specific). Responsible for physical infrastructure supporting AV systems, they ensure monitoring solutions integrate with existing building systems and meet physical installation requirements.
- [click] End users/Customers. The ultimate stakeholders. For integrators, these are clients; for tech managers, system users; for manufacturers, the people using your products. Understanding their needs is critical to success.
- [click] Additional stakeholders. This includes department heads, project managers, finance teams, and executives with interest in the monitoring initiative.

# Set clear goals

Getting started

<v-clicks>

- Goals show us the path to [success]{.highlight} in our monitoring journey
- They set the [scope]{.highlight} of our monitoring initiative
- Be [SMART]{.highlight}
  - Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound
- One person should ultimately be [responsible]{.highlight} for each goal
- Keep it [simple]{.highlight} and focused on business outcomes

</v-clicks>

<!--
- Setting clear goals is crucial for the success of any monitoring initiative.
- [click] Goals provide direction and a clear definition of success, regardless of whether you're an integrator, tech manager, or manufacturer.
- [click] Well-defined goals help establish appropriate scope, preventing "monitoring sprawl" where you try to monitor everything without clear purpose.
- [click] Follow the SMART framework: Goals should be Specific (what exactly will improve), Measurable (quantifiable metrics), Achievable (realistic targets), Relevant (aligned to business needs), and Time-bound (clear deadlines).
- [click] Assign clear ownership for each goal to ensure accountability. Someone must be responsible for tracking progress and reporting on outcomes.
- [click] Focus on business outcomes rather than technical capabilities. "Implement product telemetry" is not as powerful as "Reduce warranty claims by 15% through early issue detection."
-->

# Good goal / bad goal

Getting started

<v-clicks>

- "Solve customer/user problems faster"
- "Reduce monthly mean time to resolution (MTTR) on issues by 10% YoY"
- "Resolve issues proactively"
- "Identify and resolve 25% of critical issues before user impact by Q4"
- "Reduce cost of truck rolls / vendor support"
- "Implement remote troubleshooting capabilities and reduce on-site service trips by 5% in the first year"
- "Improve product reliability" _[manufacturer specific]_
- "Decrease product failure rates by 8% through monitoring-based preventive maintenance" _[manufacturer specific]_

</v-clicks>

<!--
- Let's compare some examples of vague goals versus specific, actionable goals.
- [click] "Solve customer/user problems faster" is too vague. How much faster? What types of problems?
- [click] A better goal is "Reduce monthly mean time to resolution on issues by 10% year-over-year" - specific, measurable, and time-bound.
- [click] "Resolve issues proactively" lacks specificity and measurement criteria.
- [click] Improved version: "Identify and resolve 25% of critical issues before user impact by Q4" - gives a clear target and timeline.
- [click] "Reduce cost of truck rolls / vendor support" doesn't specify how much or when.
- [click] Better: "Implement remote troubleshooting capabilities and reduce on-site service trips by 5% in the first year" - clearly defines the approach and expected outcome.
- [click] For manufacturers specifically, "Improve product reliability" is too general.
- [click] An improved manufacturer goal: "Decrease product failure rates by 8% through monitoring-based preventive maintenance" - connects monitoring directly to a business outcome.

  - Create pricing model and sales strategy
  - Choose between managed vs support services

</v-clicks>

::right::

<v-clicks>

- **For tech managers:**
  - Determine monitoring scope and priorities
  - Design observable systems
  - Create support processes and workflows
  - Define integration with existing systems
  - Establish reporting and dashboard requirements

</v-clicks>

<!--
- [click] For manufacturers, your approach focuses on product design:
  - Determine how monitoring will be architected in your products - which components need telemetry, what protocols to use
  - Define what data your products should collect and how frequently
  - Create comprehensive API documentation to enable third-party integration
  - Carefully balance which capabilities should be on-premise versus cloud-based
  - Consider security implications of collecting operational data from customer environments

- [click] For integrators, your approach centers on service offering:
  - Clearly define your service structure and delivery model
  - Map out the complete customer experience from sales to ongoing support
  - Develop a sustainable pricing model that aligns with customer expectations and your costs
  - Decide if you're offering managed services (with SLAs and proactive monitoring) or support services (break/fix model)

- [click] For tech managers, your approach focuses on implementation:
  - Determine which systems to monitor first based on business impact and criticality
  - Design systems to be observable from the ground up
  - Create processes for alert handling, escalation, and issue resolution

# Managed services vs Support services

Getting started - For Integrators

::left::

**Support services**

<v-clicks>

- No uptime guarantee
- Break/fix model
- Client controls access & passwords
- Client owns the equipment
- Technology focus:
  - Remote access capabilities
  - Basic monitoring for quick diagnosis
  - Reactive approach with minimal overhead

</v-clicks>

::right::

**Managed services**

<v-clicks>

- SLA-bound with penalty clauses
- Proactive management
- Provider controls access & passwords
- Provider may own/lease equipment
- Technology focus:
  - Comprehensive health modeling
  - Granular data collection
  - Continuous monitoring for SLA compliance

</v-clicks>

<!--
- This distinction is particularly relevant for integrators but also important for manufacturers to understand as they build products that support both models.
- [click] Support services represent a simpler entry point:
  - No promises about uptime, just responsive support when issues occur
  - Based on a break/fix model - something breaks, you fix it
  - The client maintains control of system access and credentials
  - The client owns all equipment
  - Your monitoring tools focus on enabling remote access and basic diagnostics

- [click] Managed services represent a more sophisticated offering:
  - Includes contractual SLAs with penalties for non-compliance
  - Focuses on proactive issue prevention rather than reactive fixing
  - The provider maintains control of access and credentials
  - The provider may own or lease equipment to the client
  - Your monitoring tools require sophisticated health modeling, detailed data collection, and SLA tracking capabilities

- For integrators just starting with monitoring, support services often provide a more accessible entry point while you build maturity. For manufacturers, understanding these different service models helps you design products that enable your channel partners to deliver either type of service.

# Product design guidance for manufacturers

Getting started - Define your approach

<v-clicks>

- Design products with built-in monitoring capabilities from the start
- Implement standardized APIs for third-party monitoring integration
- Provide clear documentation on available telemetry points
- Include appropriate security measures for all monitoring interfaces
- Consider data retention and bandwidth requirements
- Balance on-board diagnostics vs cloud-based capabilities
- Create graduated monitoring features that scale with customer needs
- Ensure monitoring capabilities are backward compatible where possible

</v-clicks>

<!--
- [click] This guidance is specifically for manufacturers designing products with monitoring capabilities.
- [click] Build monitoring into your product architecture from day one, not as an afterthought.
- [click] Implement standardized, well-documented APIs that allow integration with common monitoring platforms.
- [click] Clearly document all available telemetry points so integrators and tech managers know what data they can access.
- [click] Include robust security features including authentication, encryption, and access controls for all monitoring interfaces.
- [click] Carefully consider how much data your products should retain locally versus in the cloud, and the bandwidth implications.
- [click] Balance onboard diagnostic capabilities (which work even when networks are down) with cloud capabilities (which enable more sophisticated analysis).
- [click] Consider implementing tiered monitoring features that match different customer needs - basic monitoring for all customers, advanced capabilities for premium support tiers.
- [click] When developing new firmware or features, maintain backward compatibility for monitoring interfaces to avoid breaking existing customer implementations.
-->

# Service offer guidance for integrators

Getting started - Define your approach

<v-clicks>

- Focus on one clear support services offer before expanding
- Price by percentage of total job cost, proposed on every project
- Include remote access and monitoring as standard, with opt-out pricing
- Sell service outcomes, not monitoring software features
- Guarantee fast remote response, minimize on-site visits
- Offer multi-year contracts by default to increase retention
- Make service opt-out rather than opt-in to boost adoption
- Align sales compensation with recurring revenue goals

</v-clicks>

<!--
- [click] For integrators developing monitoring-based service offerings:
- [click] Start with a single, well-defined support service offering rather than multiple confusing options.
- [click] Price services as a percentage of the total job cost, which naturally scales with system complexity and customer investment.
- [click] Include remote capabilities by default - they're essential to effective service delivery. If customers decline, increase pricing to offset inefficiency.
- [click] Focus on selling service outcomes (like uptime or response time) rather than the technical details of your monitoring tools.
- [click] Emphasize rapid remote response rather than promising specific resolution times initially.
- [click] Offer multi-year contracts as the default to reduce annual renewal efforts and improve customer retention.
- [click] Structure proposals so customers must explicitly decline service rather than opt-in, which typically results in higher adoption rates.
- [click] Ensure your sales compensation plan rewards recurring revenue to align incentives with your business strategy.
-->

# A final check before proceeding

Getting started - Define your approach

Is your approach...

<div class="flex justify-between h-80%">

<v-clicks>

- **Desirable**
  - Will customers want and pay for it?
  - Does it solve real user problems?

- **Feasible**
  - Can your team deliver it?
  - Do you have the necessary skills?

- **Viable**
  - Will it be profitable/sustainable?
  - Does it align with your business strategy?

</v-clicks>

<img v-click src="/dvf.jpg" alt="Desirable, Feasible, Viable" class="h-80 rounded-3xl" />

</div>

<!--
- Before investing significant resources, evaluate your approach through this critical lens.
- [click] Desirability is about market demand:
  - Do you have evidence that customers want this and will pay for it?
  - For manufacturers: Are integrators asking for these monitoring capabilities?
  - For integrators: Do customers see value in monitoring-based services?
  - For tech managers: Will your monitoring solution solve real problems for users and stakeholders?
  
- [click] Feasibility addresses your capability to execute:
  - Can your team build and deliver this monitoring solution?
  - Do you have the necessary skills in-house or through partners?
  - Is the required technology mature enough to implement reliably?

- [click] Viability concerns business sustainability:
  - For manufacturers: Will monitoring features increase product value and sales?
  - For integrators: Will monitoring-based services be profitable?
  - For tech managers: Will the benefits outweigh the implementation and ongoing costs?
  - Does this initiative align with your overall business or organizational strategy?

- [click] Success requires that your approach sits in the sweet spot where all three criteria overlap. If you're missing any dimension, reconsider or adjust your approach before proceeding.

# Choose a platform

Getting started

<v-clicks>

- Align feature requirements with your specific goals
- Balance sophistication vs. simplicity for your team's capabilities
- Calculate total cost of ownership (not just upfront costs)
- Evaluate both AV-specific and general IT monitoring tools
- Consider self-hosted vs. SaaS trade-offs
- Assess security capabilities and compliance certifications
- Conduct a structured proof of value before full commitment
- Be prepared to change direction if needed

</v-clicks>

<!--
- Now that you've defined your approach, it's time to select a platform that can execute your monitoring strategy.
- [click] Start by mapping platform features directly to your goals. If your goal is reducing MTTR, prioritize diagnostics and troubleshooting features. If your goal is proactive maintenance, prioritize predictive analytics.
- [click] Consider your team's capabilities when evaluating platform complexity. Sophisticated platforms offer more capabilities but require more expertise to manage effectively.
- [click] Look beyond initial licensing costs to include implementation, training, customization, integration, and ongoing maintenance when calculating TCO.
- [click] Don't limit yourself to only AV-specific monitoring tools. Many IT monitoring platforms offer excellent capabilities that can be adapted for AV systems.
- [click] Weigh the trade-offs between self-hosted solutions (more control, potentially higher internal costs) and SaaS offerings (faster deployment, subscription costs, less customization).
- [click] Ensure the platform meets your security and compliance requirements, particularly for enterprise deployments or regulated industries.
- [click] Before full commitment, run a time-limited proof of value with clear success criteria to validate the platform's capabilities in your environment.
- [click] Be willing to pivot if your chosen platform isn't delivering expected results - it's better to change direction early than continue with an unsuitable solution.

  - Consider hardware-specific vs. vendor-neutral options carefully
- Application performance monitoring (APM)
  - New Relic, Datadog, AppDynamics, Dynatrace, Splunk, Elastic, Prometheus
- Manufacturer-provided tools _[with cautions]_
  - Often limited to specific product lines
  - May have integration challenges with multi-vendor environments

</v-clicks>

<!--
- This is not an endorsement of specific platforms - evaluate options based on your unique requirements.
- [click] General-purpose IT monitoring platforms offer broad capabilities and typically handle diverse technology ecosystems well.
  These tools have mature features but may require customization for AV-specific monitoring.
- [click] AV-specific monitoring platforms are purpose-built for our industry but vary significantly in capability.
  Be particularly careful with hardware-specific monitoring solutions that may not work well in multi-vendor environments.
- [click] APM tools focus on application performance and can be valuable for monitoring software-based AV systems and services.
  These often provide excellent analytics but may require more technical expertise to implement.
- [click] Manufacturer tools can provide deep insights into specific products but present challenges:
  - They're typically limited to that manufacturer's product line
  - They may create monitoring silos in multi-vendor environments
  - They often serve dual purposes of monitoring and marketing
  
- For manufacturers in the audience: consider how your monitoring tools can provide value while integrating well with broader ecosystem management tools.

# Start small & iterate

Getting started

<v-clicks>

- Begin with a well-defined pilot focused on representative systems
- Establish structured feedback mechanisms and review cycles
- Set clear expectations about the iterative nature of the implementation
- Define measurable success criteria for each implementation phase
- Commit to production timeline and scope to maintain momentum
- Budget time for refinement after initial deployment
- Document lessons learned to improve future phases

</v-clicks>

<!--
- The final key to success is to start small and embrace iteration rather than attempting to build the perfect solution immediately.
- [click] For your pilot:
  - Integrators should choose loyal customers who will provide honest feedback
  - Tech managers should select standard, representative systems that impact business outcomes
  - Manufacturers should work with trusted integration partners for real-world testing
- [click] Implement formal feedback mechanisms like regular review sessions, structured surveys, and usage analytics to gather actionable insights.
- [click] Set clear expectations with all stakeholders that monitoring implementation is inherently iterative - the first version will not be perfect.
- [click] Define specific, measurable success criteria for each phase so you can objectively evaluate progress and recognize when to move forward.
- [click] Set a firm date to transition from pilot to production and stick to it - avoid "permanent pilot syndrome" where you never fully commit.
- [click] Explicitly budget time after initial deployment for refinement based on early production feedback.
- [click] Maintain a lessons learned document that captures both successes and challenges to inform future phases of your monitoring journey.
